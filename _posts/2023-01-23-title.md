GO language is a c style language created by engineers at google. It is simpler and faster than c, c++, and java. It is more type-safe than ruby or python and easy to use. It has more benefits and fewer drawbacks. GO is much faster in performance. I chose the GO language because of its speed and clear hierarchy. It has gained more popularity and learning it can earn a job and career at google, a dream for many software developers. In the future, GO lang can be used in cloud services which will be helpful in the development of infrastructure that can be maintained in the long run.
