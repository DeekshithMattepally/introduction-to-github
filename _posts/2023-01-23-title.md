GO language is a c style language created by engineers at google. It is simpler and faster than c, c++, and java. It is more type-safe than ruby or python and easy to use. It has more benefits and fewer drawbacks. GO is much faster in performance. I chose the GO language because of its speed and clear hierarchy. It has gained more popularity and learning it can earn a job and career at google, a dream for many software developers. In the future, GO lang can be used in cloud services which will be helpful in the development of infrastructure that can be maintained in the long run.

Learning the GOLANG programming language was challenging as it differed from another programming Languages. 
Firstly, I have downloaded and installed GOLANG from its official website https://go.dev/ 
I installed it according to the steps on the website, and it ran successfully on my pc. 
For installing GOLANG on our PC we require a text editor and compiler
I installed VS code and downloaded the required tools in VS code to write and execute GOLANG programs. 
The first program I wrote in GOLANG is the most common across all programming languages, i.e., the HELLO WORLD program.
package main 
  
import "fmt"

func main() {

     // prints output
     fmt.Println("Hello, This is DEEKSHITH MATTEPALLY, this is my first blog post about GOLANG")
}

OUTPUT: Hello, This is DEEKSHITH MATTEPALLY, this is my first blog post about GOLANG

package main: It has the overall content of the program. It is the initial point of running the program, so writing is essential.
 
import "fmt": a preprocessor command that tells the compiler to include the files lying in the package.
 
 
func central (): it is the beginning of the execution of the program. Here, func is used to create a function in GOLANG.
 
fmt.Println: It is a standard library function to print something as a output on the screen. In this, fmt package has transmitted Println method, which is used to display the output.
 
A Go compiler is required to execute a Go program. We must first construct a program in the Go compiler and save it with the extension .go, for example first.go Now; let us test this out. Use the following command to open a go file in the go compiler, i.e.
$ go run first.go
DATA TYPES IN GOLANG: In GOLANG, data types are divided into four categories. They are 

BASIC TYPE: numbers, strings, and Boolean 
AGGREGATE TYPE: arrays and structs
REFERENCE TYPE: pointers, slices, maps, functions, and channel
INTERFACE TYPE

Here, in BASIC TYPE, numbers are categorized into three subcategories, which are 
Integers -  In the Go language, both signed and unsigned integers are available in four different sizes.
Floating-point numbers - In the Go language, floating-point numbers are divided into two categories.
Complex numbers - Complex numbers are divided into two parts. 

Example programs for numbers:

// Go program to illustrate
// the use of integers
package main
import "fmt"
                       
func main() {
           
           // Using 8-bit unsigned int
           var X uint8 = 225
           fmt.Println(X, X-3)
           
           // Using 16-bit signed int
           var Y int16 = 32767
           fmt.Println(Y+2, Y-2)
}

Output: 225 222
-32767 32765

Example program for Boolean:

          // Go program to illustrate
          // the use of booleans
          package main
          import "fmt"
          func main() 
{
           // variables
           
            str1 := "SOFTWAREENGINEERING"
            str2:= "softwareengineering"
            str3:= "SOFTWAREENGINEERING"
            
            result1:= str1 == str2
            result2:= str1 == str3
            
            // Display the result
            
            fmt.Println( result1)
            fmt.Println( result2)
            
            // Display the type of
            // result1 and result2
            
            fmt.Printf("The type of result1 is %T and "+"the type of result2 is %T", result1, result2)
}

OUTPUT: 
false
true
The type of result1 is bool and the type of result2 is bool
 
 Example program for strings: 

              // Go program to illustrate
             // the use of strings
      package main
      import "fmt"
      func main()
      {

             // str variable which stores strings
             
              str := "DEEKSHITH"
              
             // Display the length of the string
             
              fmt.Printf("Length of the string is:%d",
                                       len(str))
             // Display the string
             
              fmt.Printf("\nString is: %s", str)
              
             // Display the type of str variable
             
              fmt.Printf("\nType of str is: %T", str)
       }


OUTPUT:
Length of the string is: 9
String is: DEEKSHITH
Type of str is: string
