GO language is a c style language created by engineers at google. It is simpler and faster than c, c++, and java. It is more type-safe than ruby or python and easy to use. It has more benefits and fewer drawbacks. GO is much faster in performance. I chose the GO language because of its speed and clear hierarchy. It has gained more popularity and learning it can earn a job and career at google, a dream for many software developers. In the future, GO lang can be used in cloud services which will be helpful in the development of infrastructure that can be maintained in the long run.

Learning the GOLANG programming language was challenging as it differed from another programming Languages. 
Firstly, I have downloaded and installed GOLANG from its official website https://go.dev/ 
I installed it according to the steps on the website, and it ran successfully on my pc. 
For installing GOLANG on our PC we require a text editor and compiler
I installed VS code and downloaded the required tools in VS code to write and execute GOLANG programs. 
The first program I wrote in GOLANG is the most common across all programming languages, i.e., the HELLO WORLD program.

          package main 
          import "fmt"
          func main() 
          
        {
        
        // prints output
            fmt.Println("Hello, This is DEEKSHITH MATTEPALLY, this is my first blog post about GOLANG")
        }

OUTPUT:

        Hello, This is DEEKSHITH MATTEPALLY, this is my first blog post about GOLANG

package main: It has the overall content of the program. It is the initial point of running the program, so writing is essential.
 
import "fmt": a preprocessor command that tells the compiler to include the files lying in the package.
 
 
func central (): it is the beginning of the execution of the program. Here, func is used to create a function in GOLANG.
 
fmt.Println: It is a standard library function to print something as a output on the screen. In this, fmt package has transmitted Println method, which is used to display the output.
 
A Go compiler is required to execute a Go program. We must first construct a program in the Go compiler and save it with the extension .go, for example first.go Now; let us test this out. Use the following command to open a go file in the go compiler, i.e.
$ go run first.go
DATA TYPES IN GOLANG: In GOLANG, data types are divided into four categories. They are 

BASIC TYPE: numbers, strings, and Boolean 
AGGREGATE TYPE: arrays and structs
REFERENCE TYPE: pointers, slices, maps, functions, and channel
INTERFACE TYPE

Here, in BASIC TYPE, numbers are categorized into three subcategories, which are 
Integers -  In the Go language, both signed and unsigned integers are available in four different sizes.
Floating-point numbers - In the Go language, floating-point numbers are divided into two categories.
Complex numbers - Complex numbers are divided into two parts. 

Example programs for numbers:

           // Go program to illustrate
           // the use of integers
           package main
           import "fmt"
           func main()

        {
           
           // Using 8-bit unsigned int
           var X uint8 = 225
           fmt.Println(X, X-3)
           
           // Using 16-bit signed int
           var Y int16 = 32767
           fmt.Println(Y+2, Y-2)
        }

Output: 
        225 222
       -32767 32765

Example program for Boolean:

          // Go program to illustrate
          // the use of booleans
          package main
          import "fmt"
          func main() 
        {
          
          // variables
           
            str1 := "SOFTWAREENGINEERING"
            str2:= "softwareengineering"
            str3:= "SOFTWAREENGINEERING"
            
            result1:= str1 == str2
            result2:= str1 == str3
            
            // Display the result
            
            fmt.Println( result1)
            fmt.Println( result2)
            
            // Display the type of
            // result1 and result2
            
            fmt.Printf("The type of result1 is %T and "+"the type of result2 is %T", result1, result2)
         }

OUTPUT: 

         false
         true
         The type of result1 is bool and the type of result2 is bool
 
 Example program for strings: 

              // Go program to illustrate
             // the use of strings
      package main
      import "fmt"
      func main()
      {

             // str variable which stores strings
             
              str := "DEEKSHITH"
              
             // Display the length of the string
             
              fmt.Printf("Length of the string is:%d",
                                       len(str))
             // Display the string
             
              fmt.Printf("\nString is: %s", str)
              
             // Display the type of str variable
             
              fmt.Printf("\nType of str is: %T", str)
       }


OUTPUT:

        Length of the string is: 9
        String is: DEEKSHITH
        Type of str is: string
        
	
VARIABLES IN GO:
A typical program employs a variety of values, some of which could change as it runs. As an illustration, consider a program that manipulates user-entered values. It is possible for values entered by one user and another user to be different. As a result, using variables is important because a different user might not utilize the same values. When a user enters a new value, the computer's Random Access Memory can store it temporarily. Because the values in this area of memory change as the operation is carried out, a new term for this phenomenon called variables emerged. A variable is a reference for data that can be altered in real-time.

There are specific rules for naming variables in GO LANG, and they are.

Variables must begin with a letter or an underscore (_) but not with a numerical one.
Variable names are case-sensitive.
Keywords are not allowed to use as a variable.

In GO LANG, variables are declared in two ways, they are.

Using var keyword
          Syntax: variable_name type = expression
          
Type or the = expression can be omitted in the syntax above, but not both.
The default value for the variable's type will be used if the = expression is absent. Typically, the default value is 0.
The value-initialize in the expression determines the type of variable if the type is removed.

Using the short variable declaration
          Syntax: variable_name:= expression
          
In the expression above, the type of the expression defines the type of the variable.

Example program for using the var keyword

          package main
          import "fmt"
          func main() {
	
	var name string = "Deekshith Mattepally"
	var age int = 26
	var height float64 = 5.7

	fmt.Println("Name:", name)
	fmt.Println("Age:", age)
	fmt.Println("Height:", height) }


OUTPUT:
	
	
	Name: Deekshith Mattepally
	
	Age: 26
	
	Height: 5.7

Example program for using the short variable declaration:

          package main
          import "fmt"
          func main() {
    // Short variable declaration
    age := 24
    name := "DEEKSHITH"
    cgpa:= 4.0
    
    fmt.Println(age)
    fmt.Println(name)
    fmt.Println(cgpa)
    fmt.Printf("The type of age is %T\n", age)
    fmt.Printf("The type of name is %T\n", name)
    fmt.Printf("The type of cgpa is %T\n", cgpa) }



OUTPUT:

        24
	
	DEEKSHITH
	
	4
	
	The type of a is int
	
	The type of b is string
	
	The type of c is float64

OPERATORS IN GO LANG

Any programming language's core is its set of operators. As a result, the Go programming language is only sufficient with the use of operators. Operands can be subjected to a variety of procedures thanks to operators. According to their various functionalities, Go operators can be divided into the following categories:

Arithmetic Operators
Relational Operators
Logical Operators
Bitwise Operators
Assignment Operators
Misc Operators

ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:

They are used to perform mathematical operands.

+, -, *, /, %

	Example:
          
	  package main
          import "fmt"
          func main() {
          
	p := 34
	q := 20

		result := [4]int{p + q, p - q, p * q, p / q}
	fmt.Printf("Result of p + q = %d\n", result[0])
	fmt.Printf("Result of p - q = %d\n", result[1])
	fmt.Printf("Result of p * q = %d\n", result[2])
	fmt.Printf("Result of p / q = %d\n", result[3]) }



Output:


Result of p + q = 54

Result of p - q = 14

Result of p * q = 680

Result of p / q = 1




RELATIONAL OPERATORS: They are used to compare two values
''=='', ''!'', ''>'', ''<'', ''>='', ''<=''

  	
	Example: 
		  // Go program to illustrate the
		  // use of relational operators
                    package main
                    import "fmt"
                    func main() {

                    p:= 34
                    q:= 20
	
		// '=='(Equal To)
	result1:= p == q
	fmt.Println(result1)
		// '!='(Not Equal To)
	result2:= p != q
	fmt.Println(result2)
		// '<'(Less Than)
	result3:= p < q
	fmt.Println(result3)
		// '>'(Greater Than)
	result4:= p > q
	fmt.Println(result4)
		// '>='(Greater Than Equal To)
	result5:= p >= q
	fmt.Println(result5)
		// '<='(Less Than Equal To)
	result6:= p <= q
	fmt.Println(result6) }


Output: 
	
	false
	
	true
	
	false
	
	true
	
	true
	
	false

LOGICAL OPERATORS: They are utilized to complement the evaluation of the initial condition under consideration or to integrate two or more conditions or limitations.

Logical AND, logical OR, logical NOT

          Example:
	// Go program to illustrate the
	// use of logical operators
		package main
		import "fmt"
		func main() {
		var p int = 23
		var q int = 60
		if(p!=q && p<=q){
			fmt.Println("True")
			}
			if(p!=q || p<=q){
			fmt.Println("True")
			}
			if(!(p==q)){
			fmt.Println("True")
			} }	

Output: 
	
	True
	
	True
	
	True
	
BITWISE OPERATORS: these are used to perform bit-by-bit operations.
 & (bitwise AND), | (bitwise OR), ^ (bitwise XOR), << (left shift), >>(right shift), &^ (AND NOT)
 
	Example: 
		// Go program to illustrate the
		// use of bitwise operators
		
		package main
		import "fmt"
		func main() {
	p:= 33
	q:= 58
			
			
			// & (bitwise AND)
			result1:= p & q
			fmt.Printf("Result of p & q = %d", result1)
			// | (bitwise OR)
			result2:= p | q
			fmt.Printf("\nResult of p | q = %d", result2)
			// ^ (bitwise XOR)
			result3:= p ^ q
			fmt.Printf("\nResult of p ^ q = %d", result3)
			// << (left shift)
			result4:= p << 1
			fmt.Printf("\nResult of p << 1 = %d", result4)
			// >> (right shift)
			result5:= p >> 1
			fmt.Printf("\nResult of p >> 1 = %d", result5)
			// &^ (AND NOT)
			result6:= p &^ q
			fmt.Printf("\nResult of p &^ q = %d", result6) }

Output: 
		
		Result of p & q = 32
		
		Result of p | q = 59
		
		Result of p ^ q = 27
		
		Result of p << 1 = 66
		
		Result of p >> 1 = 16
		
		Result of p &^ q = 1

ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS: To give a variable a value, assignment operators are utilized. The assignment operator has a variable as its left-side operand and a value as its right-side operand. The variable's data type must match the value on the right side for the compiler not to produce an error.

"=" (Simple Assignment)
"+=" (Add Assignment)
"-=" (Subtract Assignment)
"*=" (Multiply Assignment)
"/=" (Division Assignment) 
"%=" (Modulus Assignment)
"&=" (Bitwise AND Assignment)
"^=" (Bitwise Exclusive OR)
"|=" (Bitwise Inclusive OR)
"<<=" (Left shift AND Assignment operator)
">>="(Right shift AND assignment operator)
	

		Example:
			// Go program to illustrate the
			// use of assignment operators
			
		  package main
		  import "fmt"	
		  func main() {
		  
	var p int = 85
	var q int = 60
			
			// "="(Simple Assignment)
		p = q
		fmt.Println(p)
			// "+="(Add Assignment)
		p += q
		fmt.Println(p)
			// "-="(Subtract Assignment)
		p -= q
		fmt.Println(p)
			// "*="(Multiply Assignment)
		p *= q
		fmt.Println(p)
			// "/="(Division Assignment)
		p /= q
		fmt.Println(p)
			// "%="(Modulus Assignment)
		p %= q
		fmt.Println(p) }


Output: 
	
	60
	
	120
	
	60
	
	3600
	
	60
	
	0

MISC OPERATORS:
"&": This operator returns the variable's address.
"*": This operator gives a pointer to a variable.
"<"-: This operator is known as receive. A value is obtained from the channel using it.

	Example:
		// Go program to illustrate the
		// use of Misc Operators

		package main
		import "fmt"
		fund main() {
	a := 6
		// Using address of operator(&) and
		// pointer indirection(*) operator
		b := &a
		fmt.Println(*b)
		*b = 9
		fmt.Println(a) }
	
Output: 
	
	
	6
	
	9

Control statements:
Making decisions in programming is equivalent to making decisions in everyday life. When the predetermined circumstance is met, the decision-making code is run. Golang employs control statements to regulate the program's execution based on specific circumstances. These are also known as the control flow statements at times. These are used to direct the flow of execution to advance and diverge in response to changes in a program's state.

DECISION-MAKING STATEMENTS IN GOLANG ARE:

IF STATEMENT:

The most straightforward decision-making statement is this one. It is used to decide whether to execute a specific word or block of statements, i.e., if a particular condition is proper, the union of statements is executed. Otherwise, not.

Syntax: 

if condition

{
	 // Statements to execute if
   	// condition is true
	
}

Example program:

	// Go program to illustrate the
	// use of if statement
		package main
		import "fmt"
		func main() 
		{
	// taking a local variable
	var v int = 700
	// using if statement for// checking the condition
	if v < 1000 
	{
	// print the following if
	// condition evaluates to true
	fmt.Printf("v is less than 1000\n")
	}
fmt.Printf("Value of v is : %d\n", v)
	}
	
	Output:
	
	v is less than 1000

	value of v is: 700

IF-ELSE STATEMENT:

A block of statements will be executed if a condition is true, and if it is false, they won't be, according to the if statement alone. But what if the condition is false, and we want to take another action? The else statement is now made. If the condition is false, we can combine the else statement with if statement to run a code block.

Syntax:
if condition {

	    // Executes this block if
	    // condition is true
	}
	else 
	{

	    // Executes this block if
	    // condition is false
	}

Example program:
	// Go program to illustrate the
	// use of if...else statement
package main
import "fmt"
func main()
{
	// taking a local variable
var v int = 1200

	// using if statement for
	// checking the condition
if v < 1000 {
		
	// print the following if
	// condition evaluates to true
	fmt.Printf("v is less than 1000\n")
	
}
	else 
{
		
	// print the following if
	// condition evaluates to true
	fmt.Printf("v is greater than 1000\n")
}
	
}

	Output:
	
		v is greater than 1000

NESTED IF statement:

A nested if in the Go programming language is an if statement that is the object of another if or else. If statements can be nested by placing another if statement inside of them. Yes, we may nest if statements inside other if statements in Golang. Hence, we can nest one if statement inside another.

Syntax:
if condition1 {
 // Executes when condition1 is true
    if condition2 {
 // Executes when condition2 is true
   }
}

Example program:
	package main
	import "fmt"

func main() {
    x := 10
    y := 20

   	 if x > 5 {
        fmt.Println("x is greater than 5")
        if y > 15 {
        fmt.Println("y is greater than 15")
        } 
	else 
	{
            fmt.Println("y is not greater than 15")
        }
    } 
    else 
    {
        fmt.Print
	ln("x is not greater than 5")
    }
}

	Output:
	
	x is greater than 5
	
	y is greater than 15


If else If statement:

A user can choose from a variety of alternatives here. The if statements are carried out bottom-up. When one of the conditions governing the if is satisfied, the statement connected to that if is carried out, and the remainder of the ladder is skipped. The final else statement will be carried out if none of the conditions are met.

Syntax:
if condition_1 {

     // this block will execute 
     // when condition_1 is true

} else if condition_2 {

    // this block will execute 
    // when condition2 is true
}
.
.
. else {

      // this block will execute when none
     // of the condition is true
}

Example program:
	package main
	import "fmt"

	func main() 
	{
   	 x := 10
	 if x < 5 
	 {
    fmt.Println("x is less than 5")
    	} 
    else if x < 15 
    	{
        fmt.Println("x is between 5 and 15")
   	} 
	else 
	{
        fmt.Println("x is greater than or equal to 15")
    }
}

	Output:

x is between 5 and 15

LOOPS IN GO LANG :

The only loop in the Go programming language is a for-loop. The repetition control structure known as a "for loop" enables us to create a loop that runs a certain number of times. This for loop has several uses in the Go programming language. They are:

FOR loop: 
It is identical to what we use in C, C++, Java, C#, and other programming languages.
Syntax: 
for initialization; condition; post{
       // statements....
}

Example:
	// Go program to illustrate the
	// use of simple for loop
package main
import "fmt"
	// Main function
func main() {
	// for loop
	// This loop starts when i = 0
	// executes till i<4 condition is true
	// post statement is i++
for i := 0; i < 4; i++{
fmt.Printf("DEEKSHITH MATTEPALLY\n")
	}
	}
	Output: 

DEEKSHITH MATTEPALLY

DEEKSHITH MATTEPALLY

DEEKSHITH MATTEPALLY

DEEKSHITH MATTEPALLY

FOR loop as infinite loop:

By deleting all three expressions from the for loop, one may also use it as an infinite loop. if the condition statement is true and the loop enters an infinite loop if the user does not include a condition statement in the for loop.

Syntax:
for{
     //statement...
}

EXAMPLE PROGRAM:
	// Go program to illustrate the
	// use of an infinite loop
package main
import "fmt"
	// Main function
func main() {
	// Infinite loop
	for {
	fmt.Printf("DEEKSHITH MATTEPALLY\n")
	}
	}

OUTPUT:

DEEKSHITH MATTEPALLY

DEEKSHITH MATTEPALLY

DEEKSHITH MATTEPALLY

DEEKSHITH MATTEPALLY

DEEKSHITH MATTEPALLY

DEEKSHITH MATTEPALLY

………………………………………………….


FOR loop as WHILE loop:
While loops can be used in place of for loops. The supplied condition must be true for this loop to continue. The loop terminates when the value of the specified condition is false.

Syntax:
for condition{
    //statement..
}

Example program:
	// Go program to illustrate the
	// the for loop as while Loop
package main
import "fmt"
	// Main function
func main() 
	{
	// while loop
	// for loop executes till
	// i < 3 condition is true
	i:= 0
	for i < 3 {
	i += 2
	}
fmt.Println(i)
}
	Output: 
	
	4

SIMPLE range in for Loop:
We can use range in for loop.

Syntax:
for i, j:= range rvariable{
   //statement..
}

Example program:

	package main

	import "fmt"

func main()
{
    nums:= []int{2, 4, 6, 8, 10}

 for index, value:= range nums {
 fmt.Printf("Index: %d, Value: %d\n", index, value)
    }

}

	OUTPUT:

Index: 0, Value: 2

Index: 1, Value: 4

Index: 2, Value: 6

Index: 3, Value: 8

Index: 4, Value: 10


Using FOR loops for STRINGS:
The Unicode code point for a string can be iterated over using a for loop.

SYNTAX:
for index, chr:= range str{
     //statement..
}

EXAMPLE PROGRAM:

	package main

	import "fmt"

func main() {
    str := "Hello, World!"

    for i := 0; i < len(str); i++ 
    {
    fmt.Printf("Character at index %d is %c\n", i, str[i])
    }
    }

	OUTPUT:
	
Character at index 0 is H

Character at index 1 is e

Character at index 2 is l

Character at index 3 is l

Character at index 4 is o

Character at index 5 is ,

Character at index 6 is  


Character at index 7 is W

Character at index 8 is o

Character at index 9 is r

Character at index 10 is l

Character at index 11 is d

Character at index 12 is !

FOR maps:
The key and value pairs in the map can be iterated over in a for loop.

Syntax:
for key, value := range map { 
     //statement.. 
}

Example program:

	// Go program to illustrate the
	// use for loop using maps
package main

import "fmt"

	// Main function
func main() {
	
	// using maps
	mmap := map[int]string{
		22:"ABC",
		33:"PHANTOM",
		44:"DEEKSHITH MATTEPALLY",
	}
	for key, value:= range mmap 
	{
	fmt.Println(key, value)
	}
	
}

	Output:

22 ABC

33 PHANTONM

44 DEEKSHITH MATTEPALLY

FOR Channel:
The channel's consecutive values can be iterated over in a for loop until the channel closes.

Syntax:
for item := range Chnl { 
     // statements..
}

Example program:

	// Go program to illustrate the
	// use for loop using channel
package main

import "fmt"

	// Main function
func main() {
	
	// using channel
	chnl := make(chan int)

SWITCH STATEMENT IN GO:
A multiway branch statement is a switch statement. Based on the value (also known as case) of the expression, it offers an effective approach to move execution to various areas of a code. The Go language supports both switch statement types, theyre:

EXPRESSION SWITCH:
Similar to the switch statement in the C, C++, and Java languages is the expression switch. It offers a simple method for allocating execution to various sections of code according on the expression's value.

Syntax:
switch optstatement; optexpression{
case expression1: Statement..
case expression2: Statement..
...
default: Statement..
}


Important notes on switch statement:
•	Opstatement and Opexpression are optional statements in the expression switch.
•	If there is an optstatement and an optexpression, a semicolon (;) must be placed between them.
•	The compiler assumes that the expression is true if the switch has no expression.
•	Simple statements like variable declarations, increment or assignment statements, function calls, etc. are included in the optional statement, also known as optstatement.
•	A variable's scope is restricted to the switch statement if it appears in the optional statement.
•	There is no break statement in the case and default statement of a switch statement. However , you may utilize the break and fallthrough statements if your application calls for itts.
•	In a switch statement, the default statement is optional.
•	If a case has numerous values that are separated by commas (,).
•	The compiler assumes that an expression is true if a case contains no expressions.

Example program:

	// Go program to illustrate the
	// concept of Expression switch
	// statement
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	
	// Switch statement with both
	// optional statement, i.e, day:=4
	// and expression, i.e, day
	switch day:=4; day{
	case 1:
	fmt.Println("Monday")
	case 2:
	fmt.Println("Tuesday")
	case 3:
	fmt.Println("Wednesday")
	case 4:
	fmt.Println("Thursday")
	case 5:
	fmt.Println("Friday")
	case 6:
	fmt.Println("Saturday")
	case 7:
	fmt.Println("Sunday")
	default:
	fmt.Println("Invalid")
}
	
}

Output: 

Thursday

Example program without default block and optional statement block:
	package main

	import "fmt"

func main() 
	// Switch statement without default statement
	// Switch statement without an optional statement and 
    

{
    name := "John"

    switch name {
    case "Alice":
        fmt.Println("Hello, Alice!")
    case "Bob":
        fmt.Println("Hello, Bob!")
    case "John":
        fmt.Println("Hello, John!")
    }
}

	Output:

Hello, John!

Type switch:
A type switch is utilized when comparing kinds. The type that will be compared with the type in the switch expression is contained in the case of this switch.

Syntax:
switch optstatement; typeswitchexpression{
case typelist 1: Statement..
case typelist 2: Statement..
...
default: Statement..
}

Important points on type switch statement:
•	The opt statement, or optional statement, is comparable to the switch expression.
•	Whenever a case allows for the possibility of several values and these values are separated by commas (,).
•	There is no break statement in the case or default statement of a switch statement. If your software requires it, though, you may utilize the break and fallthrough statements.
•	In type switch statements, the default statement is not required.
•	The typeswitch is an expression with a type as the outcome.
•	The type of that variable depends on the type present in the case clause if an expression is assigned in a typeswitchexpression using the:= operator. When there are two or more types in the case clause, the variable's type is determined by the type in which it was created in the typeswitchexpression.

Example program:
	
	package main
	import "fmt"

	func printType(v interface{})
	{
	switch v.(type) 
    	{
		case int:
		    fmt.Println("v is an integer")
		case string:
		    fmt.Println("v is a string")

	default:
	 	fmt.Println("v is of an unknown type")
	}
	}

	func main() 
	
	{
		printType(42)
		printType("hello")
		printType(true)
	
	}
	

Output:

	v is an integer

	v is a string

	v is of an unknown type
