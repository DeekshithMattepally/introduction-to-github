**What skills/knowledge that you had learned earlier in the semester was helpful in this project**

During the first semester, I took a course called "principles of software development," which is a prerequisite for the current "software engineering" course, in which I learned how to write test cases for a specific program. It helped me to understand how to write a test case for the current mini-project.

**What additional skills/knowledge you had to learn to complete your tasks**

The additional skill/knowledge I had to learn to complete my task are,

Knowledge of testing frameworks in Golang is a must required to write the test cases. Go's testing package is a robust testing framework, but getting used to its features and syntax took some time. I learned about the testing framework and worked on it to complete the test cases.

Writing test cases will undoubtedly encounter problems. Using debugging tools and techniques to troubleshoot the issues helped me to create successful test cases. I experienced many difficulties and bugs initially, but I learned how to use and implement debugging tools.

**What is the biggest challenge you faced during mini-project**

Creating test cases for the Golang mini-project "library management system" was difficult for me. It required learning the system's functionality, creating specific test cases, managing dependencies, troubleshooting failing test cases, and staying current with system updates. 
The biggest challenge I faced was to write the test cases without any errors and be able to run successfully. learning how to use debugging tools and techniques to troubleshoot failing test cases helped me to get through it.
